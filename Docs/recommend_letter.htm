teaching Sara in her 11th grade honors English class at Mark Twain High School.
From the first day of class, Sara impressed me with her ability to be
articulate about difficult concepts and texts, her sensitivity to the nuances
within literature, and her passion for reading, writing, and creative
expression- both in and out of the classroom. Sara is a talented literary
critic and poet, and she has my highest recommendation as a student and writer.</span></em></p>

style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>Sara is talented at
considering the subtleties within literature and the purpose behind authors'
works. She produced an extraordinary year-long thesis paper on creative
identity development, in which she compared works from three different time
periods and synthesized cultural and historical perspectives to inform her
analysis. When called upon to give her thesis defense in front of her peers,
Sara spoke clearly and eloquently about her conclusions and responded to
questions in a thoughtful way. Outside of the classroom, Sara is dedicated to her
literary pursuits, especially to poetry. She publishes her poetry in our
school's literary magazine, as well as in online magazines. She is an
insightful, sensitive, and deeply self-aware individual driven to explore art,
writing, and a deeper understanding of the human condition.</span></em></p>

style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>Throughout the year Sara
was an active participant in our discussions, and she always supported her
peers. Her caring nature and personality allow her to work well with others in
a team setting, as she always respects others' opinions even when they differ
from her own. When we held a class debate about gun laws, Sara opted to speak
for the side opposite her own views. She explained her choice as motivated by a
desire to put herself in other people's shoes, view the issues from a new
perspective, and gain a clearer sense of the issue from all angles. Throughout
the year, Sara demonstrated this openness to and empathy for the opinions,
feelings, and perspectives of others, along with shrewd powers of observation,
all qualities that makes her outstanding as a student of literature and
burgeoning writer.</span></em></p>
